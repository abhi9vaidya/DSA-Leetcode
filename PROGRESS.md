# Progress Tracker

Use this file to track problems you solve, their language, and status.

Columns:
- Problem: zero-padded LeetCode ID and short title (e.g., `0001. two-sum`)
- Language: `java`, `python`, `cpp`, etc.
- Status: `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`, `review`
- Notes: short notes, links, or file path to solution

Example:

| Problem | Language | Status | Notes |
|--------:|:--------:|:-----:|:------|
| 0001. two-sum | python | done | `python/0001_two_sum.py` — O(n) using hash map |

Add a new row for each problem you start solving. Keep the table updated so you can track progress across languages and topics.

You can also use this file to plan weekly goals or tag problems by topic using prefixes like `[arrays]`, `[dp]`, `[graphs]`.
