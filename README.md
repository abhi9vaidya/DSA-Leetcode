# DSA Leetcode

A personal repository to collect Data Structures & Algorithms solutions and notes, focused on LeetCode problems.

## Repository Structure

- `arrays/` - array problems and helper utilities
- `linked_lists/` - singly/doubly linked list problems
- `strings/` - string manipulation problems
- `trees/` - binary tree, BST problems
- `graphs/` - graph algorithms and traversals
- `dynamic_programming/` - DP problems and patterns
- `sorting/` - sorting-based problems and helpers
- `backtracking/` - permutation, combination, subset problems
- `misc/` - other algorithms and utilities

## How I use this repo

- Each problem should have its own file named with the problem number and short title, e.g. `0001.two-sum.java` or `0001_two_sum.py` depending on language.
- Include a short problem statement, approach notes, and complexity analysis at the top of each solution file.

## Conventions

- Use zero-padded LeetCode problem numbers for ordering (e.g., `0001`, `0015`, `0123`).
- Keep solutions small and focused; include unit tests when useful.

## Getting started (local)

Open the repository folder and create a language-specific folder for your preferred language (e.g., `java/`, `python/`).

Example: initialize git and commit (optional):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\abhin\Desktop\VIsem\Test\DSA-Leetcode"
git init ; git add . ; git commit -m "chore: initialize DSA Leetcode repo with README"
```

## Contributing

- Add problems you solve and follow the naming and documentation conventions above.
- Create pull requests if collaborating with others.

Happy coding!
